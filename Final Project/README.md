# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on the techniques for the detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). We employed two primary models for the final task of the project: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), to classify patient data and predict the likelihood of CKD.

#The key contributions of each team member were:

* **Anish Paul:** [Describe contributions, e.g., Data preprocessing, MLP model development, Report writing].
* **Akash Mitra:** [Describe contributions, e.g., 1D CNN model development, Experimentation, Visualization].
* **Ekra Bintay Ismail:** [Describe contributions, e.g., Literature review, Data analysis, Results interpretation].

## Project Goals

* Develop models capable of accurately detecting CKD.
* Compare the performance of MLP and 1D CNN models in this specific application.
* Provide a valuable tool for early detection and potential intervention for CKD.

*Model Evaluation:**
 * Evaluated the performance of both MLP and 1D CNN models on the testing set.
 * Metrics used for evaluation: [List metrics, e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC].


## Results
